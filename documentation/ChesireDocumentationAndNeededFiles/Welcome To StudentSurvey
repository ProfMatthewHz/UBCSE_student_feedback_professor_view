**instructions on what database file is needed.** 

 - Within the StudentSurvey repo, in the location StudentSurvey/backend/lib/ you will find a database.php file 
 - Open the file and you will see following function connectToDatabase()
 - Within that function you will see four variables with certain values, we need to update those values as they will only work for XAMPP
 - DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'; 
 - $DATABASE_USER = 'root'; 
 - $DATABASE_PASS = null;  
 - $DATABASE_NAME = 'test';
 - These values need to be updated to hold the following 
 - DATABASE_HOST = 'oceanus.cse.buffalo.edu:3306'; 
 - $DATABASE_USER = 'UBIT'; 
 - $DATABASE_PASS = UBITPASSWORD;  
 - $DATABASE_NAME = 'cse302_2023_fall_team_aj_db';
 - Within StudentSurvey/documentation/ChesireDocumentationAndNeededFiles, you will see a file called database.php
 - This is how the database.php file should look after you have made your changes
 - After these changes have been to the database.php file in StudentSurvey/backend/lib/ save the file
 - You are going to want to make sure this file is saved and uploaded into cheshire during the initial uploading of the entirety of StudentSurvey to cheshire. 
 - If it is not uploaded initially, you can just update the file and upload to cheshire using the methods explained above.
